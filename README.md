# Exasol Workshop Starter

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork this repo

Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this page to create your own copy.

### 2. Set the passphrase

Your instructor will share the passphrase during the workshop.

Via the web UI:

1. Go to [github.com/settings/codespaces](https://github.com/settings/codespaces) → New secret
2. Name: `WORKSHOP_PASSPHRASE`
3. Value: the passphrase from your instructor
4. Repository access: select your fork (`<your-username>/exasol-workshop-starter`)

Or via the CLI:

```bash
gh secret set WORKSHOP_PASSPHRASE --user --repos <your-username>/exasol-workshop-starter --app codespaces
# paste the passphrase when prompted
```

### 3. Create a Codespace

Via the web UI: go to your fork → Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main

Or via the CLI:

```bash
gh codespace create --repo <your-username>/exasol-workshop-starter --branch main --machine basicLinux32gb
gh codespace ssh  # or open in VS Code
```

AWS access is configured automatically. Verify:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

Credentials refresh automatically in the background. No keys to manage.

### If it didn't work

If you created the Codespace before setting the secret, either rebuild it
(`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Rebuild Container") or run manually:

```bash
bash .devcontainer/setup-aws.sh
```

Enter the passphrase when prompted. Then open a new terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`.

### Troubleshooting

- Codespace created before setting the secret? Rebuild it: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Rebuild Container"
- "Wrong passphrase"? Double-check with your instructor
- Permission errors on AWS? Ask your instructor — the role may need updated permissions
